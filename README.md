# Telemetry Framework

An exercise in networked software. This framework will provide a way for people to monitor various resources on network connected machines.
Things I've learned while building this:

* Network progamming via ZeroMQ
* Binary serializtion via Google's flatbuffers
* Building asynchronous request-reply patterns.
* Implementing RPC (Remote Procesure Call)
